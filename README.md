# Web Scraping and Text Analysis of Game Reviews on Rock Paper Shotgun

### Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a school NLP project. The project focuses on leveraging web scraping & topic modelling techniques to extract and analyse game reviews from the chosen website - Rock Paper Shotgun (https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reviews). 

The code and comments for building the dataset & conducting text analysis are available in the submitted zip file and on GitHub (https://git.arts.ac.uk/23001934/rps-game-reviews-web-scrape).

### Dataset

rps_links_output_file.json - JSON file contains all the titles and links on RPS
game_reviews_rps_in_recent_years.json 
game_reviews_rps_in_recent_years.csv
game_reivews_rps_in_recent_years (folder)

The dataset can be reviewed in JSON, CSV, and TXT formats, all available in the submitted zip file and on GitHub (https://git.arts.ac.uk/23001934/rps-game-reviews-web-scrape). Please note that the dataset only covers the reviews in the recent three and half years (published from 01/06/2020 to 01/12/2023 on RPS), with the raw dataset (contains missing data and incorrect data) available in the 'test_output' file for comparison purposes.

For more information on the dataset, please refer to the datasheet (`rps_datasheet.md`)
