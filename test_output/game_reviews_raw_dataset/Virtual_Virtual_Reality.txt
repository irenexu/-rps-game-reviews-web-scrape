Virtual Virtual Reality is a virtual reality game about virtual reality. As the newest human employee of Activitude, it's your job to put on virtual reality headsets and fulfill the desires of the AIs you meet inside. Those AIs include: a block of butter who wants you to stick pieces of toast to him, and a lonely pinwheel who wants you to water his flowers. As self-consciously wacky as that sounds, in descriptions the game mostly comes across as derivative of half a dozen more famous others, including Portal, Job Simulator, and Accounting. Thankfully, V-VR finds its own identity, and is executed so superbly that it can sit almost shoulder-to-shoulder with that stellar company. Let's say shoulder-to-elbow.
