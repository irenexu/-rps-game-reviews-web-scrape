Like its predecessor Gravity Bone, Blendo Games' Thirty Flights of Loving is a short-form tale of cool criminals in a cuboid world, told from a first-person perspective with a hyper-compressed, non-linear narrative that focuses only on the drama and comedy, not the filler. Here's what I made of it. Thirty Flights of Loving is out now. It has a developer's commentary too. It costs about four quid. Buy it.
