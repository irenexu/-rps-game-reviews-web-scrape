Of course you remember Aliens, right? Who could forget Danny Glover kicking ass on the Discovery One, Sarah Hamilton shouting, "That's how they git you. They're under the goddamned ground!" Ah, the memories. John's spent the day ploughing through Aliens: Colonial Marines, so he can tell you wot he thinks:As you've probably already heard, Aliens: Colonial Marines is terrible. Properly terrible. The sort of terrible where you see that it was apparently made by Gearbox, and decide that SEGA may have just forgotten that it wasn't really. Making a game featuring Aliens has somehow eluded developers since around 2000, which always seems strange - the film was basically the ingredients of a game. But like trying to make an advert for sofas, it seems impossible for anyone to create anything that doesn't make you cringe into a little ball. But wow, Colonial Marines has taken that to the next level.Not only is it a truly dreadful addition to the Aliens canon, and only ever even trying to be a very mediocre shooter, but it's somehow taken six years to develop a game that feels not only a decade old, but utterly falling to pieces. The textures often look like they're from the original Unreal, character models are archaic, and animations are generally laugh-out-loud terribad. It glitches, it's packed with bugs, it has the terrible checkpointing you're already expecting, the weapons feel like they're made of clingfilm, and on and on and on. And perhaps most ridiculously of all, you spend far more of your time shooting at moronic man enemies than you do at the swarms of aliens. It consistently delivers a series of wonders, whether technical idiocy or outrageously awful writing, so I want to convey that experience to you via the notes I took when alt-tabbing out of the game. Here they are in chronological order, along with some captured video of favourite moments.          The saddest thing to report is that Aliens: Colonial Marine doesn't even achieve that "so bad you just have to see it" place. The innumerous bugs only frustrate, rather than offering the surprising jazz-style joy of a Soldner. ("Soldner".) And it's not even the "If you found a copy in a charity shop you'd have to experience it" level of awful that something like the Starshop Troopers game offered. Although as I was playing, that was the game that came to mind most frequently. (Weirdly, the defunct team who made Starship Troopers, Strangelite, now mostly work for Rebellion, who made the execrable Rogue Warrior and Aliens Vs. Predator for Sega in 2010. Small world.) It occupies that worst of gaming spaces - just a very badly put together game that's infuriatingly tedious to play. It's pretty telling that it's when you're just shooting men in corridors that it's its most passable - you slump into the muscle memory of it all and pass the time. It's every time an alien comes on screen that you know unfair deaths, dreary, repetitive combat, and broken code is coming to the front.It'll be fascinating to learn what went wrong in spending half a decade making this game, once enough time has passed that everyone will speak. Until then, there's nothing of interest at all within, especially for those with a great passion for the Aliens franchise. Yes, this is now official canon, but no, you don't want to know it.
